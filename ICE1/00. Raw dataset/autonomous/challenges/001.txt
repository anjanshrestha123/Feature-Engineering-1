3. Traffic conditions

Autonomous cars would have to get onto the road where they would have to drive in all sorts of traffic conditions. They would have to drive with other autonomous cars on the road, and at the same time, there would also be a lot of humans. Wherever humans are involved, there are involved a lot of emotions. Traffic could be highly moderated and self-regulated. But often there are cases where people may be breaking traffic rules. An object may turn up in unexpected conditions. In the case of dense traffic, even the movement of few cms per minute does matter. One canâ€™t wait endlessly for traffic to automatically clear and have some precondition to start moving. If more of such cars on the road are waiting for traffic to get cleared, ultimately that may result in a traffic deadlock.
